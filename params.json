{"name":"DevilDust","tagline":"This is only the beginning","body":"#Welcome to the DevilDust!  \r\n##Project UpDate Oct. 16, 2015.  \r\n\r\n###Initial News Release  \r\n\r\n**Author: pAxton**\r\n\r\n\r\nDevilDust is a Mod for Arma 3.  It currently has been in development since April of this year, with some time off in between.  Many basics features of the mod are in semi-working condition.  Several 3D models have been added to   \r\nthe game as long with textures.  Some characters also have been re-textured. \r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/DevilDust/DevilDust/blob/master/%40DevilDust/Source_Code/DevilImage.jpg)\r\n\r\n###Concept of the Game mode\r\n\r\nThe mod, DevilDust, is centered around generating income so you can purchase weapons and other unique supplies to the mod.  We will be able to loot materials to create drugs and sell them to the users in game.  The goal of this mod is to generate intense gun fights and tactical play with incentives to staying alive.  There is a thirst, hunger and addiction system in development.  Since I do not want to spoil the surprises I will leave it at that.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n2015 Founder of DevilDust: @pAxton-\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the Mod?
